# pubg_external_sdk
A collection of source files which help develop mainly external cheats for the game PUBG.
Some classes may be outdated, due to many updates since the last time this was updated.
Many classes might be named wrong, due to class inheritance and me not paying attention.

Thanks to:
 * [TJ888](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/members/180284.html) for always uploading a dumped SDK which always helped developing my cheat.
 * [codectile](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/members/1443393.html) for his (actually really) crappy esp source, which helped me understand how the Unreal Engine works (partially).
 * [Striekcarl](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/members/1183367.html) for publishing a lot of stuff in the PUBG section.
